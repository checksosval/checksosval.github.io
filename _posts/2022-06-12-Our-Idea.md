subtitle: How to attract delegators?
---

Some of the validators have extensive experience as active validators. As a result, it may be simple for them to recruit delegators.
But what's the deal with the newcomers? What can we do to entice folks to join us?

With the current numbers of wales declining (https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/whale), we thought the following might be a good idea:

'We decided to donate half of the monthly revenue to a non-profit organization' 

Meet: [Sea Shepherd](https://seashepherd.org/)

"Sea Shepherd’s sole mission is to protect and conserve the world’s oceans and marine wildlife. We work to defend all marine wildlife, from whales and dolphins, to sharks and rays, to fish and krill, without exception."

We'll post on a monthly basis the revenue and the donations made to Sea Sheperd.

P.S. You might be wondering why Sea Shepherd? Kujira means *wale* in Japanese, and the first time I heard about Sea Sheperd was about them saving wales, so I thought this might be a good fit.
