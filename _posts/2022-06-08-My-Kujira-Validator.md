subtitle: Some information about our Kujira Validator

It all began in May 2022, shortly after the Luna crash.
I've been following the Kujira project since the beginning and have been blown away by the team's energy and, more importantly, their ideas.

After the team decided to create their own L1 and stated that they were searching for Validators, I chose to construct my own.

I've been in the active set of validators on the testnet so far, and I'm hoping to be in the active set on the mainnet as well.
